# Starbound Mod: The Galactic Federation of Webbs
Adds in Webbers to Starbound
# WARNING:
I am in NO WAY responsible for your saves with this modded Starbound race. If your saves get corrupted, you play with (possibly) conflicting mods, your spider friends go missing, your cat dies, your pizza doesn't get delivered, or net neutrality ends, I AM NOT LIABLE for the damages that may be associated with this mod. That being said, IF YOU EVER GET A CRASH WITH THIS MOD IN YOUR STARBOUND, send me the log and I'll determine if it's ACTUALLY my fault or you're bothering me with something not related to this mod. This mod is already large, and it's as unstable as it is huge to the power of six.

FOR THOSE PLAYING WEBBERS LIKE THEY'RE FULLY COMPLETE AND DON'T WANT TO LOSE ANYTHING IF THIS MOD HAS A MAJOR UPDATE:

I have a few personal warnings here.

With the coloring methods the humanoid sprites have- oops. That already happened. Sorry about bricking the appearance of your old characters, but as long as this warning is up here, your newer characters aren’t safe from the updates. Not. Yet.

Sorry.

Also, don't trust every single update on the GitHib repository. Like above, when I say this is unstable with the measurement of size^6, I mean it. I recommend waiting for the next stable release (In a .pak) if you aren't testing or collaborating on this.

Thank you for listening to my warnings.
# FEATURES:

- An actual wiki in the making.

- Pets!

- NPCs from villagers to tougher guards.

- Webbers DO have FR support as of now. the stats are a bit wonky but they'll be fixed. They’ve been rebalanced, but not exactly in much of the lore-friendly way.

- Partially incomplete custom ships, but hey, Tiers 0-4 aren't the recolors again.

- MOSTLY custom shape humanoids. They have big, weirdly shaped heads and an extra pixel or two on the feet. (No seriously, they can't wear most hats)

- LORE! It's more lore-friendly for Starbound really, but ok.

- A GitHub repository. You're viewing it right now. You can freely test out stuff before it gets released, but be careful.

- Bugs. You decide the meaning of this feature.

- Custom dungeons/microdungeons/villages.

- Character customization: Yeah, it's there. Webbers do like some nice hair styles, don't they? Including fur colors and patterns.

- Hurt soun- no. Please don't hurt these "endangered" species just to hear them cry. Don't. You'll make me cry. Speaking of which, the synthesizer falling from a flight of stairs has been replaced with the most lovely phrase in existance: “HECK”

- Tenants: They're still not your annoying next-door neighbors, so they're disappointing.

- Nyctophobia: Webbers are probably the first race to have a crippling fear of the dark. (PLAY WITH FRACKIN' RACES FOR FULL EFFECT)

- Custom S.A.I.L: Comes with Webber-specific dialogue. Also space humor. Now with an annoying inbox for you to read.

- Weapons and clothing/armors: Still a huge WIP. There’s already a customized weapon building system.

Thought I'd also need to make this statement.

PS: No log, no fix. Don't send empty bug reports unless if it is only a visual bug.
